## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (`#000000`) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.(For an "AI" look, don't just use flat colors. Use a **Radial Gradient** for your background. Set the center to a very dark blue (`#1e293b`) and the edges to black (`#020617`). This creates a "glow" behind your content that makes it feel like a futuristic interface.)
- Primary color: Soft teal (##2563EB) for subtle accents and highlights.
- Accent color: Muted green (#F8FAFC), slightly lighter than the primary, used to bring depth to the teal without overpowering the minimalist palette.  **Secondary Accent:** `#1E293B` (Slate Blue — for dividers/lines)
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Use simple, line-based icons to maintain a minimalist style.
- Employ a single-column layout to improve readability.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations when loading new content.
